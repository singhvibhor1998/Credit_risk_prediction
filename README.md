# 💳 Credit Risk Prediction App

A simple **Streamlit web application** that predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to be a **good** or **bad** credit risk based on their financial and demographic information.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a **Machine Learning model** for credit risk prediction using **Extra Trees Classifier** and **Streamlit** for interactive visualization.

Users can input applicant information (age, job type, housing, savings, etc.) and instantly get a prediction of their credit risk category.

## 🧠 Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Extra Trees Classifier  
- **Encoders**: LabelEncoder objects trained on categorical columns  
- **Frameworks**: scikit-learn, pandas, Streamlit  

The model and encoders were pre-trained on a historical credit dataset and saved using `joblib`.
